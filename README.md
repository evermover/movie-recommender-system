A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity.

Movie Recommendation System Using Cosine Similarities
This project uses the TMDB credits dataset to recommend movies to users.
The dataset contains information about the cast and crew of movies,
which is used to calculate the cosine similarities between movies. 
The movies with the highest cosine similarities to a user's favorite 
movies are then recommended to the user.

## Output
The output will be a list of movies, ranked by their cosine similarities 
to the user's favorite movies.

## Limitations:
The system is limited by the quality of the TMDB credits dataset. The dataset is constantly being updated, so the recommendations may change over time. Additionally, the system is only as good as the movies that are in the dataset. If a user's favorite movies are not in the dataset, the system will not be able to recommend any movies to them.

## Future work:
The system could be improved by using a more comprehensive dataset of movies. Additionally, the system could be improved by using a more sophisticated recommendation algorithm.
